                <h2>Business All Christmas</h2>
                <p>The best tasting masa in town and a variety of tamale fillings are what make her menu unique. 
                    Angelica's tamales are crafted with love and a rich history of culinary passion behind them. Inspired by the 
                    flavors of Veracruz, Mexico, they are now a hallmark delicacy for holiday gatherings of Yumans that are 
                    in-the-know. </p>
                <p>2023 culminated with her biggest event yet, the Old Town Christmas Festival in our Historic Downtown Yuma.</p>

                Angelica is proud to see her children flourish and establish roots. They come home to celebrate and 
            share their successes like home-ownership, college  and culinary school graduation, and marriage. </p>
