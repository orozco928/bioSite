                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>The fundamentals of culinary and business management were an everyday practice for Angelica from a 
                    young age. The family craft would be passed onto her from her mom Praxedes, a stoic woman whose 
                    business would not only sustain their family but secure their education. Forward progress for their 
                    humble beginnings in a declining Poza Rica, Veracruz. </p>
                <p>She leaves home at 16, and marries soon after. The resourceful pair would grow a seafood
                     business into a state-wide enterprise. Despite their successes, they would part ways due to gambling 
                     addiction and financial instability. Contending with her first pregnancy, she was moving forward 
                     and away to establish herself a new beginning. </p>
                <p>Pregnant and starting over, she heads north to opportunity in the United States. The early years were 
                    isolating. She works her way up the ranks in popular restaurants while slowly finding her place in the  
                    community. She works in restaurant management before eventually starting her own food business. </p>
                <p>She lives and breathes Mexican food, dancing with the distinctive flavors of her home region on the dishes 
                    that are already so popular here in the Southwest. Her signature tamales are a local favorite here, her 
                    current menu offering 7 different kinds. </p>
                <p>Angelica is also proud to have raised 4 children (17 - 28 years of age) with her husband Rogelio, who passed 
                    away in May of 2020. She describes her experience as a mother with great fondness, beaming with pride at the 
                    early-life accomplishments of her children like home ownership, college graduations and the like. </p>
                <p>She plans  to continue operating her food truck for several years to come, but leaves the door open for one 
                    of her own to carry the family business when the time is right. </p>
