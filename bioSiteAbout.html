                     business into a state-wide enterprise. Despite their successes, they would part ways due to a gambling 
                     addiction and financial abuse on his part. Contending with her first pregnancy, she was moving forward 
                     and away to establish herself a new beginning. </p>

                <p>She lives and breathes Mexican food, dancing with the distinctive flavors of her home region on the dishes 
                    that are already so popular here in the Southwest. Her signature tamales are a local favorite here, her 
                    current menu offering 7 different kinds. </p>
                <p>Angelica is also proud to have raised 4 children (17 - 28 years of age) with her husband Rogelio, who passed 
                    away in May of 2020. She describes her experience as a mother with great fondness, beaming with pride at the 
                    early-life accomplishments of her children like home ownership, college graduations and the like. </p>
